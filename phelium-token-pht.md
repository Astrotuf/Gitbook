# ðŸª™ Phelium Token (PHT)

#### Introduction:

At PlanetSWH, we are proud to introduce a new eco-friendly token built on the Polygon blockchain. Our token, Phelium Token, was designed with a focus on sustainability and a commitment to minimizing our carbon footprint.

Helium (He) is the second most abundant element in the universe but is actually quite rare on Earth. Phelium Token is an simple ERC-20 polygon governance token for the PlansetSWH Metaverse.&#x20;

Phelium Token holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, lend, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $PHT when they interact with various activities within the ecosystem and through user-generated content initiatives.

#### Background:

As the world becomes increasingly aware of the need for environmentally responsible solutions, it is important for the blockchain industry to do its part in reducing its impact on the planet. The energy consumption of traditional blockchain networks has been a major concern, and we believe that it is possible to create a more sustainable alternative.

Features of Phelium Token:

* Built on the Polygon blockchain, which is known for its low transaction fees and high scalability.
* Designed with a focus on energy efficiency, using a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that requires significantly less energy than proof-of-work algorithms.
* Committed to transparency and full disclosure of our energy consumption and carbon offset initiatives.
* Supports a variety of use cases.

Phelium is a humble but ambitious effort to create a more eco-friendly and sustainable token.&#x20;

We believe that it is possible to create a blockchain-based solution that is both powerful and responsible, and we are committed to doing our part to reduce the industry's carbon footprint.&#x20;

We hope that Phelium Token will be the first of many efforts to create a more sustainable future for the blockchain industry

### Goal of the token? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-cff01850-774e-9191-62d8-3f9b10b62652" id="docs-internal-guid-cff01850-774e-9191-62d8-3f9b10b62652"></a>

Collectively put our minds together and build a eco-energy friendly token.

#### - When will it be on an exchange?

Exchanges can make or break a coin. The cheapest options will only lead to disappointing performance. Therefore, we are saving for a decent exchange listing.

#### - Why have you been developing this since Dec 2021?

I didn't want to create something that would just be flash in the pan, I wanted to try my best to create something thatâ€™ll last.

#### - Which charity would you like to donate to?

We have a very humbly small development team wallet but If we see a community or organization in need of aid weâ€™ll do what we can to set something up for them.

We will use proceeds to provide the following in various regions around the world.
