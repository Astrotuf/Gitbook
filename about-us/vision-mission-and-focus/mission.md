# Mission

{% hint style="info" %}
In times of environmental crisis, coordination failure, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, our generation can work together to turn the tide of climate change.

We strongly suspect that these super-earths are rocky and composed primarily of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, and nickel," says François Soubiran, a Marie Skodowska-Curie scholar working at France's École Normale Supérieure de Lyon as part of the EU-funded ABISSE project.

&#x20;"On average, practically every star has a super-earth, indicating that they are highly common and that we may find life on one or more of them."&#x20;

However, little is known about these massive earth replicas.

### THAT’s WHY WE SHOULD NOT DESTROY OURS !

Soubiran concludes. "Numerical simulations are an excellent tool for learning."
