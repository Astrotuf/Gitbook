**The Issue: The invisible hand works to produce wealth in our capitalist system, and individual self-interest rules.**

The freedom to produce and consume as we see appropriate creates value for the economy, allowing the entire society to succeed. We generally believe that the market is reasonable and that everything is valued perfectly.

**Every day, we disregard the paradoxes in front of us. Water, a necessary for life, is virtually free across (most of) the world; diamonds, on the other hand, have no actual utility for us and are priced exorbitantly on the free market, excluding all but the world's wealthy.**

Historically, the market price of a good was decided by the socially required labor inputs required to produce it. We have recently shifted to a system in which subjectivity and speculation are major driving forces behind prices.

For many, the'marketplace' is no longer a real location where two people exchange products or services. In order to develop personal wealth, we buy assets that we will never touch and often do not comprehend.

**Value has become completely divorced from the'market'. So much so that when an item or service destroys value, often immensely, the market imposes no consequence.**

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that reduces our planet's ability to allow heat escape when it is present.

Carbon dioxide's effect on our global climate is already causing changes in our planet's most fragile ecosystems: it is bleaching coral reefs, melting permafrost beneath northern tundra, and contributing to tropical deserts. The market does not penalize carbon dioxide emissions. The market does not value what we actually value.

**The answer: Climate change is the most pressing issue confronting our age.**

Carbon dioxide has no boundaries, and neither do the effects of global warming. The only way to combat global warming is to mobilize worldwide action.

#### Web3 is the ideal venue to combine these markets because it has enough liquidity to have an impact at scale, smart contracts can securely and transparently manage transactions, and contributions can be equitably incentivized.
