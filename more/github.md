## Is the code open-source?

The underlying code is open-source and anyone can deploy contracts, a relayer, and a cli to perform basic operations. The UI is not currently open-source to avoid simple clones. Source code is available here. [https://github.com/Astrotuf?tab=repositories](https://github.com/Astrotuf?tab=repositories)
