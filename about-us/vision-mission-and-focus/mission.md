# Mission

{% hint style="info" %}
LEAVE THE WORLD BETTER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION

In times of environmental crisis, coordination failure, and increasing greenhouse gas emissions, our generation can work together to turn the tide of climate change.

We strongly suspect that these super-Earths are rocky and composed primarily of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, and nickel," says François Soubiran, a Marie Skodowska-Curie scholar working at France's École Normale Supérieure de Lyon as part of the EU-funded ABISSE project.

&#x20;"On average, practically every star has a super-Earth, indicating that they are highly common and that we may find life on one or more of them."&#x20;

However, little is known about these massive Earth replicas.

### THAT’s WHY WE SHOULD NOT DESTROY OURS

Soubiran concludes. "Numerical simulations are an excellent tool for learning."
