# Focus

The science is clear. To keep 1.5 alive we need reductions, resilience and removals. The delivery of a resilient, zero carbon world in time to ensure a safe climate means reducing our CO2 emissions by at least 50% or more by 2030, reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and staying at net-negative emissions throughout the second half of the century.

Carbon removal provides a unique opportunity to provide green jobs and skills, increase financial flow to emerging economies, positively impact biodiversity, tackle food security and many others. Today, we are removing far less than a gigaton per year.  To scale this action up, capital investment in CDR should reach $100 Billion per year by 2030 (up from an estimated $10 billion today).&#x20;

CDR refers to any human-led efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere (not a point source, such as an exhaust, smokestack or flue-stack or natural sinks, such as pre-existing ecosystems).

The NFT market has grown inexorably, with trade volumes jumping from $74 million at the start of 2021 to $25 billion by the end of the year. Since then, growth has only escalated, with NFT trading volumes reaching $12 billion in the first quarter of 2022 alone.

The proof-of-work approach demands the same amount of electricity as an ordinary American home over nearly nine days to mint a single NFT. When the same NFT is acquired and sold, the same amount of energy is expended.&#x20;

In other words, one NFT transaction on Ethereum consumes the same amount of energy as about 331,056 Visa transactions or 24,895 hours of YouTube viewing

According to the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report (2020), nature loss threatens to disrupt more than half of the world's GDP ($44 trillion). Because of the enormous value that natural capital provides, all industries, from fishing and agriculture to building and pharmaceuticals, have a strong interest in safeguarding it. Nature-friendly business strategies, on the other hand, have the potential to generate $10 trillion in yearly revenue and 395 million jobs by 2030.

Furthermore, businesses do not exist apart from the communities in which they operate, all of which rely on a healthy environment for existence and well-being. Regardless matter how organizations look at it, the cost of ignoring these repercussions is simply too high.

### From habitable worlds to hot Jupiters, the Planetary Metaverse Simulator has it all.

PlanetSWH aspires to be a groundbreaking virtual experience in which users can create then interact with known discovered planets as a metaverse in which they can unleash their creativity.

Using blockchain scalability, deep learning, and AI to learn more about these super-earths and see if they can support life while having fun and saving our planet from catastrophic climate change.&#x20;
