# üëã Welcome

**The Issue: The invisible hand works to produce wealth in our capitalist system, and individual self-interest rules.**

The freedom to produce and consume as we see appropriate creates value for the economy, allowing the entire society to succeed. We generally believe that the market is reasonable and that everything is valued perfectly.

**Every day, we disregard the paradoxes in front of us. Water, a necessary for life, is virtually free across (most of) the world; diamonds, on the other hand, have no actual utility for us and are priced exorbitantly on the free market, excluding all but the world's wealthy.**

Historically, the market price of a good was decided by the socially required labor inputs required to produce it. We have recently shifted to a system in which subjectivity and speculation are major driving forces behind prices.

For many, the'marketplace' is no longer a real location where two people exchange products or services. In order to develop personal wealth, we buy assets that we will never touch and often do not comprehend.

**Value has become completely divorced from the'market'. So much so that when an item or service destroys value, often immensely, the market imposes no consequence.**

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that reduces our planet's ability to allow heat escape when it is present.

Carbon dioxide's effect on our global climate is already causing changes in our planet's most fragile ecosystems: it is bleaching coral reefs, melting permafrost beneath northern tundra, and contributing to tropical deserts. The market does not penalize carbon dioxide emissions. The market does not value what we actually value.

**The answer: Climate change is the most pressing issue confronting our age.**

Carbon dioxide has no boundaries, and neither do the effects of global warming. The only way to combat global warming is to mobilize worldwide action.

#### Web3 is the ideal venue to combine these markets because it has enough liquidity to have an impact at scale, smart contracts can securely and transparently manage transactions, and contributions can be equitably incentivized.

### AFRICA HOLDS THE KEY üóùÔ∏è

[Africa holds the key](https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/can-africa-be-a-continent-of-solutions-to-the-climate-crisis/) to accelerating global climate action. The continent doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúold economy‚Äù that needs to be decarbonized. It can invest right away in the green economy that we need ‚Äî an economy that‚Äôs net positive for the planet and the people. Importantly, if African countries were to grow to middle income status with a similar emission per capita as current middle income countries, we can forget about keeping peak warming below 1.5 degrees.

**A holistic, long-term approach**

Managing the climate crisis requires a holistic, long-term approach. No single country, sector, organization or individual can do it alone. We need to bring together all stakeholders, that is, public, private and not-for-profit, and we need a long-term plan starting today.

The key is to secure the kind and level of political support needed for the magnitude of the shift that is required to address the climate crisis. For example, following a series of devastating wildfires and weather-related disasters, Greece established the Ministry for Climate Crisis and Civil Protection to integrate climate resilience in disaster risk management.

**Creating value from restoring nature**

An ambitious international agreement on the protection of nature will be welcomed by our members who are committed to Resilience First‚Äôs vision of a safer, healthier world where businesses, communities and the planet can thrive in harmony.

An agreement such as the Global Biodiversity Framework has the potential to accelerate a systemic shift in policy, regulation, stakeholder demands and market behaviours. By providing greater clarity on the value and impact of nature on production and supply chains, an effective agreement can provide not just a regulatory, but also a clear monetary, incentive for businesses to find ways of creating value from restoring nature.

Putting a price on nature will help organisations realise the real costs of doing business on this planet, and incentivise the development of new products and services that meaningfully advance their own contribution to this urgent and imperative agenda.&#x20;
